Project Description:
This project focuses on predicting the number of bikes rented in a bike-sharing system using historical data. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can forecast demand based on factors like weather, season, time of day, and day of the week.

By analyzing past rental patterns, the model helps bike-sharing companies prepare better â€” like deciding how many bikes to place at each station, when to expect high or low demand, and how weather affects usage. This is especially useful for optimizing operations and improving customer satisfaction.

What the Project Covers:
Understanding the key features that influence bike rental demand (e.g., temperature, humidity, time, holidays)

Preprocessing and cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and convert time-based features

Visualizing trends (e.g., more rentals on weekends, less on rainy days)

Building and evaluating regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Measuring model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook for development and presentation

Outcome:
The final model accurately predicts bike rental demand based on various input conditions. It demonstrates how data science and machine learning can help businesses make data-driven decisions in real time. This project is a great example of applying predictive analytics to a real-world urban mobility problem.
